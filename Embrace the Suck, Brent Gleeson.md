<p>If you can’t learn to control your mind, you’ll forever be a slave to its evil limitations.</p>

<p>The 40 percent rule tells us that when we start to fell mentally and physically excursion we have only used up 40 percent of our resources. The body will start sending signal to slow down, it will try to stop us long before we have reached our full potential. We can go a lot further, remember this when we fell to tired to go on</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Location: 98</p>
<p>But when we find ways to harness our minds, we can defy all odds.</p>

<p>Please tell him that my words will make no difference when his balls are in his stomach from being so cold. Men don’t get many chances to show their grit! You need to pray for bad weather! Pray for the coldest water! Pray for a broken fucking body! You should want the worst-case scenario for everything you do in Hell Week! Pray for it to be so hard that only your fucking boat crew makes it all the way through! They succeed because you lead those motherfuckers through the worst Hell Week ever! You have to become the devil to get through Hell! This shit is about your fucking mindset! If you are hoping for the fucking best-case scenario in Hell Week, you are not ready! Know that no motherfucker can endure what you can. Not because you believe in yourself. But because you have trained harder than any motherfucker alive! You might think this is a fucking motivational speech! Well it’s not! This is my mentality before I go into any fucking war. Hell Week is not for the faint of heart. It’s for that motherfucker looking for the beginning of his soul. You want to see where most people end, and you begin. Be that guy; when everyone is in pain and miserable with their heads hanging low, you’re the one smiling! Not a friendly smile, but one that says, “You think this fucking shit can hurt me?!” This is your time to start creating the person you want to be! You can’t make that man in a soft fucking environment! You must be willing to suffer more than anyone else! Not because you have to, but because you want to! I leave you with this: many people are looking for hard shit so they can prove themselves, but once the hard shit comes, the reality is too much to bear. Be watching for “the look”! You will know it once you see it. It’s like their soul is leaving their body. It happens during deep suffering, when a person can no longer handle the mental pain and anguish of what they thought they could do. The key word is “thought” they could do! After you see the look, quitting is very near. So, what the fuck are you going to do when your balls are in your stomach from the cold? What are you going to do when your body is broke as fuck and you have fifty hours left? What are you going to do when your boat crew starts to quit and you feel alone? What are you going to do when it won’t stop raining and you can’t get warm? I don’t know what you’re going to do. But you asked me for my advice, so here’s what the fuck I did: I prayed to God to make it worse! Mindset! Go to war with yourself!</p>
<p>Note:Show your have grit. Don’t give up. I like this, often when we get a chance to show ourself we imagine us succeeding and the pleasure of success. But we never imagine the pain and suffering, the hard times we will need to embrace to get the success. Therefore, we often quit as soon as something get remotely unpleasant. We quit long before our resources as emptied. To succeed and show you grit continue</p>
<p>Note | Location: 106</p>
<p>This is embracing the pain, expect it seek it. That makes us less likely to quit when we meet it. We grow when we experience discomfort, so seek it. Don’t avoid it</p>
<p>Note | Location: 107</p>
<p>You are not ready if you don’t expect a struggle. It you are not prepared to look the struggle in the eye and challenge it</p>
<p>Note | Location: 108</p>
<p>We are not special, but we can train to get ready. Train, repeat at attack the struggle</p>

<p>You can’t hurt me</p>

<p>Developing resilience largely depends on our ability to change the narrative in our minds around the inevitable challenges we face in life and find new answers to these important questions:</p>
<p>Note:This is a similar point to the one in kunsren at vare fuckimg ligeglad. Vi har altid kontrol over hvordan vi ser on our current situarion and thus we have full control. Even when aomething like coronA virus comes along we can determine how we see percievd the situariom and how we react</p>

<p>Are emotional and physical pain realities to be avoided or embraced?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 2</p>
<p>Am I willing to embrace extreme discomfort to live my extraordinary life?</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 2</p>
<p>deliberately pounding away at the boundaries of their comfort zone in pursuit of their passions and causes greater than themselves. Simply put, they choose adversity over mediocrity and continue pushing forward despite the odds stacked against them.</p>
<p>Note:If you always stay in your comfort zone you will nevee grow</p>

<p>If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Note:I really like this quote.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 3</p>
<p>The overarching answer is simple. Resilience is like any muscle. With focus and determination—and some of the tools in this book—you can strengthen your mind to overcome any obstacle,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 5</p>
<p>grit, resilience, and a deep passion to serve as a SEAL rank at the top.</p>

<p>According to Dweck, in a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.</p>
<p>Note:This is the believe we can learn anthing as long as we put in the work. No skill is fixed. In alot of ways this is the antidote to the dianey view where we are born with a certain gift</p>

<p>People with this mindset are comfortable being uncomfortable. Transparent feedback is not just accepted but craved, and setbacks are just another bump in the road fueling the fire to push forward.</p>
<p>Note:I need to take this approach to talking my beliefs. Its stilll uncomfortable forr me to stand up and say what i mean. But emmbrace the uncormfort to grow</p>

<p>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not: unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. So,</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 9</p>
<p>Nothing great in this world comes without a little bit of adversity. Nothing amazing happens inside our comfort zones.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 26</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to wrap your head around an uncomfortable situation, then the following happens: As soon as your brain receives input, the synapses start to fire their little electrons and look for pre-existing structures to attach your new input to—such as hypothermia, bone fractures, and flesh-eating bacteria. But in this case, there just isn’t any place for the electrons to attach because the input is new, shitty, and unfamiliar—it doesn’t quite fit anywhere.</p>

<p>Suck it the fuck up. You earned your right to be here. You have a long way to go, so embrace the suck and get it done.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28</p>
<p>To avoid pain is basically to deny our own potential. You don’t build muscle or physical stamina without experiencing pain.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28</p>
<p>And let’s just say you don’t reach peak mental and physical toughness without embracing a whole lot of suck. As the famed Marine Corps officer Chesty Puller said, “Pain is weakness leaving the body.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 28</p>
<p>Becoming more resilient starts with changing your perspective on adversity. Pain can in fact be transformed into a useful energy force for accomplishing great feats. For gaining perspective. For building physical and emotional resilience. When you can master the ability to control pain whatever form it comes in—and even lean into it, it doesn’t have to hurt so badly.</p>
<p>Note:Dont fear the pain seek it embrave it</p>

<p>Let me ask you this. When the hell have you ever accomplished anything spectacular while nestled safely in your comfort zone? We both know the answer. Never. We all know today’s culture has a fascination with risk-takers and we crave motivational social media posts that keep our head in the game.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 30</p>
<p>Because the very instincts we humans once needed to avoid the pain of being devoured by a saber-toothed cat or attacked by a band of marauding warriors are the same that keep us from taking new risks. Venturing out. Trying new things. Getting out there in that big scary world and saying fuck it. Saying yes to life. The good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>

<p>THE ACT: Fully experience your pain and emotions.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 32</p>
<p>THE ACT: Challenge your perspective. THE PROCESS: The downward spiral never lasts forever, hence the saying “This too shall pass.”</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 32</p>
<p>THE ACT: Surround yourself with the right influences.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33</p>
<p>THE ACT: Stay (or become) active and avoid negative coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33</p>
<p>THE ACT: Know that bad things don’t actually come in threes (not sure I totally believe this yet).</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 33</p>
<p>THE ACT: Accept and forgive.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 51</p>
<p>Causal thinking and analysis paralysis can keep us locked in our tiny box of mediocrity, content to eat Ritz crackers and watch daytime TV, impairing our ability to learn from bad experiences and take fucking action.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 52</p>
<p>If it doesn’t involve at least a little bit of pain, adversity, or challenge, it’s not worth doing.</p>
<p>Note:Its portant to remember this. We cant achieve something without pushing ourself. If we stay in the comfort zone we will not grow. Always choose the action that will make you grow</p>

<p>When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.</p>
<p>Note | Page: 67</p>
<p>We should live with the end in mind. Dont bother what other people think of you know. When on the death bed the people who disagreed with you wont matter or be important to the live you have lived or if you fell it like a success or not. Speak your mind now, live your life, you cant do it when its all ove</p>

<p>James Clear, American author, entrepreneur, and world-famous photographer, says, “Making better choices is often a matter of choosing better constraints. By limiting your options to those that fit your values, you are taking an important step to ensuring that your behavior matches your beliefs.</p>

<p>He cared so deeply about becoming a SEAL and giving to a cause greater than himself that he was willing to risk it all in chasing that dream. His paddle is a constant reminder to me of the importance of living a values-driven life.</p>
<p>Note:What are my values? It need to align myself with my values</p>

<p>In times of war or uncertainty there is a special breed of warrior ready to answer our nation’s call. A common man with an uncommon desire to succeed. Forged by adversity, he stands alongside America’s finest special operations forces to serve his country, the American people, and protect their way of life. I am that man.</p>
<p>Note:So beautiful this. A common man</p>

<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 69</p>
<p>By wearing the Trident I accept the responsibility of my chosen profession and way of life. It is a privilege that I must earn every day. My loyalty to country and team is beyond reproach.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight | Page: 69</p>
<p>I will never quit. I persevere and thrive on adversity. My Nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies. If knocked down, I will get back up, every time.</p>
